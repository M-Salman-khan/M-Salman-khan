## About Me

I'm a passionate and dedicated student currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE). I'm deeply interested in full-stack web development and software engineering, and Iâ€™m always eager to explore new technologies and solve real-world problems.

Currently, I'm diving into the MERN stack and RESTful APIs to build scalable, modern web applications. I also have hands-on experience in SQL, Python, C++, C, and front-end technologies like HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS. Alongside, I'm strengthening my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
